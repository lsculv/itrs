# itrs (`it`)
itrs is a simple command line tool that provides command-line access to some
useful Rust iterator and string methods. These may be more memorable subtitute for
some quick `awk` commands or common command-line idioms like `sort | uniq`.
itrs provides a single executable that can access the various subcommands by name.
